## Instaces

An instance of the Moving Firefighter Problem consists of two main parts: a fire graph and a firefighter graph.

- The fire graph `G_fire` represents the instance seen from the fire's point of view; this graph with $n$ nodes in $[0,1]^d$ and the edge weights set to $1$ is created following a particular procedure (depending on the generator).
- The firefighter graph `G_fighter` represents the instance seen from the firefighter's point of view; it has $n+1$ nodes: the same $n$ nodes of the fire graph and an extra node representing the firefighter. The firefighter graph is a complete graph with edge weights created or computed according to the generator.

Every MFP instance provides the following attributes:

- `A`. The $n \times n$ adjacency matrix of the fire graph.
- `D`. The $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ distance matrix of the firefighter graph where the last row and column are the firefighter distances to every node.
- `fighter_pos`. The $d$-dimensional firefighter position.
- `node_pos`. A $n \times d$ matrix with the node positions.
- `num_fires`. List with the indices of the initial burnt nodes.
- `G_fire`. Networkx fire graph.
- `G_fighter`. Networkx firefighter graph.

## Generators

MFP generators follow different strategies to create random instances. In all cases, by default, the initial position of the firefighter is selected at random in $[0,1]^d$; in the same way, once the number of initial fires is selected, their position is randomly set among all nodes.

Currently, these generators are available:

- Base generators
  - **Erdos:** Nodes of an ErdÅ‘s-RÃ©nyi graph are placed randomly, with a uniform probability in $[0,1]^d$. Each of the possible edges is added with probability $p$. Euclidean distances are assigned to every edge in the firefighter graph.
  - **Geometric:** The $n$ nodes are uniformly sampled from the $[0,1]^d$ï¿¼space. Edges are included in the graph if the Euclidean distance is inferior o equal to a given radius r. Euclidean distances are assigned to every edge in the firefighter graph.
  - **No Metric Erdos:** An Erdos instance with random weights (distances) in a given interval assigned to each edge in the firefighter graph.
  - **REDS:** The $n$ nodes are placed randomly, with a uniform probability in the unit square $[0,1]^2$. The edges are generated following the Energy-Constrained Spatial Social Network Model proposed in <https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/364826/>. Euclidean distances are assigned to every edge in the firefighter graph.
